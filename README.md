## overview
A to do website created using Django allowing you to track yours and your subordinates tasks

## UX Design Process

### User stories

1. Authentication & Profiles

- As a user, I want to sign up and log in so that I can securely access my tasks.
- As a user, I want to edit my profile (name, email, boss) so that my information stays up to date.
- As a manager, I want to set who reports to me so that I can assign them tasks.

2. Task Management

- As a user, I want to create a task for myself so that I can track my personal work.
- As a manager, I want to create a task for my subordinates so that I can delegate work.
- As a manager, I want to assign a task to all users under my hierarchy so that I can broadcast important tasks (e.g., team meetings).
- As a user, I want to view all tasks assigned to me so that I know what I need to complete.
- As a user, I want to update the status of a task (e.g., Pending → Done) so that I can track progress.
- As a user, I want to delete my own tasks so that I can keep my task list clean.

3. Hierarchy & Permissions

- As a user, I want to see who my boss is so that I know my reporting line.
- As a manager, I want to view all my subordinates so that I know who I can assign tasks to.
- As a manager, I want to see tasks I’ve assigned to others so that I can track their progress.

4. Chatbot Integration

- As a user, I want to ask the chatbot to create a task for me so that I can save time.
- As a manager, I want to ask the chatbot to assign a task to all my subordinates so that I can quickly delegate work.
- As a user, I want the chatbot to list my pending tasks so that I can quickly review my workload.
